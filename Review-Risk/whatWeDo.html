<h1>Bank Guard - Lender's Insurance Consultancy Services</h1> <br>
<p>Being Named Loss Payee on Your Borrowers Insurance Policy may not get you what you think! If your
borrower suffers either a full or partial loss, will the insurance proceeds be enough to payoff your loan? Your
clients risk managers are constantly making tough decisions between cost and coverage without your
knowledge. <br>
Our banking clients ask us to review their borrower's current insurance program to determine if they, as the
lender, are facing any unforeseen insurance risk from both collateral and a future cash flow perspective.
We believe Insurance Due Diligence should be addressed before a loss occurs. Our unique approach towards
our client's interests brings the focus on insurance due diligence.
Our goals are to ensure that the lenders insurable interests are properly executed, to identify any obstacles to
a full recovery of the lenders insurable interest(s) and to provide the lender with recommendations that
would rectify or mitigate such obstacles before a loss occurs.  <br> Understanding the terms and conditions of your
borrower's insurance contracts (policies), along with your rights and obligations as a secured lender under
these policies, is as important as understanding the terms and conditions of the financing agreement
between you and your borrower.
Our team works in an independent atmosphere of technical experience and confidentiality that can be
tailored to fit the needs and requirements of even the largest and most diverse lender. Our flexibility lets you
choose the review's focus and to tailor the end product to meet your specific needs.
The scope of our Lender Insurance Reviews can be limited to insurance compliance issues in which we can
assist in obtaining and reviewing required insurance documentation to ensure that the lenders insurable
interests are properly documented. Different risks present different concerns. </p>
